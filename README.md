This repo is going to be me exploring NLP analysis and AI/ML implementation. 

A few ideas that I want to look at are
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Hate Speech Detection
3. Bot Detection

This is likely to go nowhere; however, it may end up being useful for Fediverse management and at least I will learn something new.
